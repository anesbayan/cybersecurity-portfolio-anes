# My Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me
Hi! I'm Anes Bayan, an aspiring cybersecurity and cloud professional.  
Currently learning **Security+**, Linux & Windows fundamentals, and **AWS cloud security**.  
I am building a hands-on portfolio to showcase practical skills, labs, and projects.

---

## Skills I Am Learning
- **Security+ Concepts:** Threats, access control, encryption, logging, incident response  
- **Operating Systems:** Linux administration, Windows administration  
- **Cloud Security:** AWS IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch  
- **Scripting / Automation:** Bash, PowerShell  

---

## Portfolio Structure

### 1. SecurityPlus_Labs/
- **Linux/** – Labs for Security+ objectives in Linux  
  - Example placeholder: `01_users_permissions.md`  
  - Screenshots will be added in `screenshots/`  
- **Windows/** – Labs for Security+ objectives in Windows  
  - Example placeholder: `01_users_groups.md`  
  - Screenshots will be added in `screenshots/`  

### 2. AWS_Projects/
- Hands-on projects demonstrating cloud security and architecture skills  
  - Example placeholders: `01_IAM_Policies.md`, `02_EC2_VPC.md`  
  - Architecture diagrams will be added in `diagrams/`  

### 3. Scripts/
- Bash & PowerShell scripts used in labs and automation  

### 4. Diagrams/
- Architecture diagrams for labs and AWS projects  

---

## How to Navigate
- Each lab/project folder contains a **markdown file** (`.md`) with:
  - **Objective** – What the lab/project is about  
  - **Steps** – Commands or actions performed  
  - **Outcome / Learning** – What was achieved  
  - **Screenshots / Diagrams** – Visual proof of work  

- Screenshots go in the `screenshots/` subfolders  
- AWS diagrams go in the `diagrams/` folder  

---

## Next Steps
- Complete **Security+ study (3–4 days)**  
- Perform **hands-on Linux & Windows labs**, documenting each lab in the markdown files  
- Start **AWS labs and projects**, capturing screenshots and architecture diagrams  
- Update README.md and folder contents as portfolio grows

*This portfolio is a work-in-progress. All labs, screenshots, and diagrams will be added as I complete each hands-on project.*
